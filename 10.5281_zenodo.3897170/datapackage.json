  "description": "Fe chemical speciation of filtered seawater data are presented in this dataset, resulting from samples collected from a trace metal rosette on board the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). During the austral summer of 2016/2017, seawater samples were collected from the Atlantic and Indian Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean and dissolved Fe concentration, iron-binding organic ligands concentration and the conditional stability constant of Feâ€™ are presented here.",
