    "description": "Dissolved trace metal (Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) concentrations in the Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean from the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition, 2016-2017.\n\nDissolved trace metal (Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) concentrations measured on seawater samples from the Southern Ocean. Samples were collected with a trace metal clean rosette system to a maximum depth of 1000 m during Legs 1 and 2 of the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE), 2016-2017. Samples were filtered through Akropak Supor filters (0.2 um) in a class 100 clean container, acidified to pH â‰¤ 2 and stored until analysis (>6 months). Samples from Leg 1 (TMR Casts 3-7) were collected during a transect from Cape Town, South Africa to Hobart, Australia. Samples from Leg 2 (TMR casts 8-20) were collected during a transect from Hobart, Australia to Punta Arenas, Chile. Data cover environments near subantarctic and Antarctic islands (TMR 3, 4, 13-15), in the Mertz Glacier Polynya (TMR 11-12) and near the Antarctic Peninsula (TMR 18), as well as meridional transects to and from the Antarctic continent (TMR 7-12, TMR 18-20).",
