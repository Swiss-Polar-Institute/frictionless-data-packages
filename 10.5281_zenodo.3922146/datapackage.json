  "title": "Ionic composition of particulate matter (PM10) from high-volume sampling over the Southern Ocean during the austral summer of 2016/2017 on board the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE).",
  "description": "Aerosol particles originate from a variety of sources (Tomasi and Lupi, 2017). Information on particle chemical composition can be utilized to access particle origin. During the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) cruise around the Southern Ocean, off-line filter sampling of ambient air was performed. Filters were stored on the ship (at -20 degrees C) and after the cruise concluded analysed at Leibniz-Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS) concerning ionic composition of sampled material. Here, we give mass concentrations for inorganic ions (chloride, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, nitrate, sulphate, and bromide), organic constituents (methane-sulfonic acid and oxalate), and total filter load of particles with a mobility diameter smaller 10 micrometers (PM10) for each 24 hour-sampled filter.",
