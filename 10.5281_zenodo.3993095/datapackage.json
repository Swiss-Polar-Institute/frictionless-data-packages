  "description": "This dataset contains filter pad method measurements of particulate light absorption by particles sampled during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) Leg 1-3. Water samples were collected from the underway seawater supply every 3 hours and at multiple depths from selected CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) rosette deployments. Seawater samples were filtered onto glass fibre filters, preserved and optical density measured using a spectrophotometer. Absorption coefficients for particulate matter were calculated from optical density measurements. The dataset also contains a small set of measurements of absorption by non-pigmented particles (non-algal particulates) measured after a methanol bleaching protocol. These measurements contribute to the determination of the inherent optical properties of the waters sampled during ACE, specifically the absorption of UV and visible wavelengths by particulate material.",
