  "description": "Flux of particles (snow, rain and other particles including sea spray) were recorded passing through a photo-electric snow particle counter installed on board the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov as part of the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). Data were recorded from January to March 2017 in the Southern Ocean. \n\nHere we present the finalised, quality-checked, horizontal particle flux data where counts have been averaged over a one-minute period.",
