Each directory within this repository refers to a published dataset that is named by its Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Note that the "/" from the DOI has been replaced by "_", so the directory 10.5281_zenodo.3634411 refers to the DOI [10.5281/zenodo.3634411](https:doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3634411).

Each dataset is described by a JSON file, datapackage.json. The tabular data files are described by a separate JSON file, tableschema.json.
