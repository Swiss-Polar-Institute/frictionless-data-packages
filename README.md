Describing datasets using Frictionless data schemas

This repository describes a dataset (otherwise known as a data package) using the Frictionless data schemas. 

Each directory refers to a published dataset that is named by its Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Note that the "/" from the DOI has been replaced by "_", so the directory 10.5281_zenodo.3634411 refers to the DOI 10.5281/zenodo.3634411.

Within each directory, each data package is described by a JSON file, datapackage.json and the tabular data files are described by a separate JSON file, tableschema.json.
