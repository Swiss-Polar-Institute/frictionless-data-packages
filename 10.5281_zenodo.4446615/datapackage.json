  "description": "Flux of particles (snow, rain and other particles including sea spray) were recorded passing through a photo-electric snow particle counter (SPC) installed on board the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov as part of the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). Data were recorded from January to March 2017 in the Southern Ocean. Here we present the raw data set, which consists of the number of particles, classified into size bins, passing through the snow particle counter with a time resolution of one second. Generally, data are presented in daily files and have undergone some pre-processing.",
